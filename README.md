## Hi there 👋
<div align=center>
  <h2>I'm Gian Santos</h2>
</div>
I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer, leaning towards back-end, and have professional experience in the health/fintech/civil industries. 

I'm currently looking for other opportunities, preferably back-end focused or full-stack. 

I'm currently learning Golang and using Raspberry Pis and Arduinos for fun.
